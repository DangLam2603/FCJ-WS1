#### Overview 

**Elastic Beanstalk** is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It allows developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in various languages such as Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers like Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

With **Elastic Beanstalk**, you simply upload your code, and the service automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. This frees developers from dealing with infrastructure management, letting them focus on writing code.
