It includes phases for installing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application. Customize it by specifying build commands, environment variables, and artifact locations to match your project’s needs. Procfile: Used primarily in platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the Procfile specifies the commands to start various application processes, such as web servers or worker processes. Define the types of processes and their corresponding startup commands to ensure the application runs correctly.

This frees developers from dealing with infrastructure management, letting them focus on writing code.\nElastic Beanstalk Advantage\nSimplified Deployment: Easy to deploy applications without managing infrastructure. Automatic Scaling: Automatically scales applications based on demand. Built-In Monitoring: Integrated with AWS CloudWatch for real-time health monitoring. Multi-Language Support: Supports various programming languages and platforms. Customizable Environments: Flexibility to customize the environment as needed. Version Control: Easy version management with rollback capabilities. Cost-Effective: Pay only for the resources used, no additional cost for Elastic Beanstalk.

Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests, allowing teams to detect problems early.\nContinuous Delivery (CD): Extends CI by automatically deploying the application to a staging or production environment after successful builds and tests. This ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.\nAWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery service that automates the steps required to release your software. With CodePipeline, you can define a series of stages, such as source, build, test, and deploy, which are triggered automatically when changes are detected in the source code repository.\nKey Features:\nAutomated Workflows: Automates the entire release process from code changes to deployment. Integration with AWS Services: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like CodeBuild, ECS, Lambda, and S3. Customizable Pipelines: Allows you to customize each stage of your pipeline, including using third-party tools or custom scripts. Parallel Execution: Supports parallel execution of actions to speed up the release process. Built-In Security: Offers encryption and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control. AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages ready for deployment. It eliminates the need to set up and manage your own build servers.\nKey Features:\nScalability: Automatically scales to handle multiple builds simultaneously, ensuring fast and reliable build times. Customizable Build Environment: Allows you to define your own build environments using Docker images, making it flexible for different programming languages and tools. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines: Easily integrates with AWS CodePipeline and other CI/CD tools to automate the build process as part of your deployment pipeline. Pay-As-You-Go Pricing: Charges only for the compute resources you use during the build process, making it cost-effective. "
